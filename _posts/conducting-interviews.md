# Conducting interviews as a software engineer

There is a lot of information out there on interviews. I would say most of it is information on how to be a good interviewee, not a good interviewer. I also think that the interview mini-game is not played right and riddled with wrong behaviours.

Conducting interviews is one of those skills that nobody is taught, you see how the people that interview you behave and you will copy them once you begin conducting interviews yourself. Speaking on my behalf, bad interviews are energy drains, no matter the which side of the table your chair is in. Let's see how we can improve this experience.

You have to make sure you know what the purpose of the interview is! Make sure you speak with your people person inside your company responsible for the hiring process. What is the purpose of the interview? It could be seniority level (senior, junior, unicorn, ninja) or the ability to comunicate solutions to complex problems.

## About to actual interview

I like to start out by asking about prior job experience. You should study their resume and have some questions prepared. Listen carefully and make sure the other person knows you are engaged in the conversation. Don't talk about yourself unless asked to. I've been part of interviews where people conducting the interview won't stop talking about themselves and their experiences.

If you have questions, make sure they are well thought out. Don't ask: _Tell me about yourself_. It's a bit too personal and way too open ended. Stay away from: how old are you, do you have a partner, do you plan on having children. Those questions are creepy, and, in some places, illegal.

The start of the interview should be easy-going. You just want to get to know the other person.

> Tell me one thing that you had to struggle with in your career.

Bad managers, horrible colleagues, spagetti codebase, caffeine addiction. People get to deal with lots of things, and trust me, they have an answer for this question.

> What is a difficult problem that you had to solve.

This one, I have to admit, is mostly for myself. I love to hear solutions to difficult problems. Sometimes you see a problem they hated to solve, sometimes it's something they love.

Respect their time! We live in a society where people pay with their time to get interviewed for your company's job. Try to be concise and efficient with your time.

When you have a good sense about the interviewee, it's time to ask something technical. Avoid the pop quiz strategy of asking: what is _insert javascript technical term like closure, this, prototype_. People study those terms for interviews. Find real code examples and have the interviewee explain what is going on. Don't make them feel bad about not knowing or getting some things wrong. Explain the concept briefly and move on. If they have a bad time, don't be mean. Let them know everyone is not at 100% during interviews, as they might be difficult at times.

> Center this div

Oh how horrible is this one. For some people flex is not enough. You have to use this criptic solution that will never go past code review. If you have to test for css knowledge, find a more creative problem. Have a simple design that they can implement or a fun CSS Battle exercise. You want to test for the ability to their job, not some weird edgy problem.
