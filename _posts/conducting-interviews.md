# Conducting interviews as a software engineer

There is a lot of information out there on interviews. I would say most of it is information on how to be a good interviewee, not a good interviewer. I also think that the interview mini-game is not played right and riddled with wrong behaviours.

Conducting interviews is one of those skills that nobody is taught, you see how the people that interview you behave and you will copy them once you begin conducting interviews yourself. Speaking on my behalf, bad interviews are energy drains, no matter the which side of the table your chair is in. Let's see how we can improve this experience.

You have to make sure you know what the purpose of the interview is! Make sure you speak with your people person inside your company responsible for the hiring process. What is the purpose of the interview? It could be seniority level (senior, junior, unicorn, ninja) or the ability to comunicate solutions to complex problems.

## About starting the interview

I like to start out by asking about prior job experience. You should study their resume and have some questions prepared. Listen carefully and make sure the other person knows you are engaged in the conversation. Don't talk about yourself unless asked to. I've been part of interviews where people conducting the interview won't stop talking about themselves and their experiences.

If you have questions, make sure they are well thought out. Don't ask: _Tell me about yourself_. It's a bit too personal and way too open ended. Stay away from: how old are you, do you have a partner, do you plan on having children. Those questions are creepy, and, in some places, illegal.

The start of the interview should be easy-going. You just want to get to know the other person.

> Tell me one thing that you had to struggle with in your career.

Bad managers, horrible colleagues, spagetti codebase, caffeine addiction. People get to deal with lots of things, and trust me, they have an answer for this question.

> What is a difficult problem that you had to solve.

This one, I have to admit, is mostly for myself. I love to hear solutions to difficult problems. Sometimes you see a problem they hated to solve, sometimes it's something they love.

Respect their time! We live in a society where people pay with their time to get interviewed for your company's job. Try to be concise and efficient with your time.

When you have a good sense about the interviewee, it's time to ask something technical. Avoid the pop quiz strategy of asking: what is _insert javascript technical term like closure, this, prototype_. People study those terms for interviews. Find real code examples and have the interviewee explain what is going on. Don't make them feel bad about not knowing or getting some things wrong. Explain the concept briefly and move on. If they have a bad time, don't be mean. Let them know everyone is not at 100% during interviews, as they might be difficult at times.

## What to test for

Don't test like your highscool math teacher. This should feel like a discussion between colleagues, not that time your literature teacher quized you about some dull novel that you spaced out while trying to read. Have a bit of awareness on how the conversation is going. Acknoledge from time to time that interviewes are not quizes, but conversations. We are people, stress doesn't always bring up the best in us. If the person you are interviewing doesn't feel stressed, you will get the best impression on who they are.

A good skill for software engineers to have is to break complex problems into smaller ones. Sometimes I ask problems we had to solve during the job, like a bug or a complex feature. Have this prepared. If you just thought about this on the fly, chances are you won't explain it properly. If nothing comes up, ask people to break down youtube or facebook into components (this can be a frontend and a backend question). If you take notes, make sure you let them know. If you type while they answer it might look like you are not paying attention.

> Center this div

Oh how horrible is this one. For some people flex is not enough. You have to use this criptic solution that will never go past code review. If you have to test for css knowledge, find a more creative problem. Have a simple design that they can implement or a fun CSS Battle exercise. You want to test for the ability to their job, not some weird edgy problem.

I don't enjoy live coding exercises, but if you do there are some things you should keep in mind. Don't write code on a whiteboard, unless the person choses to do this. Let them know there is going to be some coding involved. Ask they what they prefer to type on, so you can have it prepared. They can bring their own laptop or do the interview over the internet.

> Here is this algorithm you will never use during the job. Write the solution in this MS Word document.

Don't be this sadistic. What does this elitistic way of coding have to do anything with the job. First of all, who codes in MS Word? Also, nobody does reverse binary tree on the job. If you have solve it, you can ask a colleague to explain the solution or google it. Test for what matters.

If the job requires a lot of algorithmic thinking, think of a real world problem. If they find a solution that uses an algorithm, just stop it there. There is no point in making them implement it. Abstract the algorithm into a function and carry on.

Don't expect for the interviewee to have the same preferences as you. If they enjoy redux as much as you, it doesn't mean they are a better or worse programmer. Hear the person out. If you don't agree with them, make sure you are on the same wave-length. Ask why and then say your opinion. Make a joke and move on, don't dwell on disagreements.

## Don't be tricked by your bias.

My job is best done by a person exactly like me. It's too easy to think that, and to interview for that. Keep in mind not all software engineers should be the same. Heterogeneity usually is a good thing. Some people are good with databases, other people are great at comunicating. There is a place for everyone. It's you job to determine if it a good fit.

Some people mask discrimination with not being a good fit or incompatible with the company culture. This has happened with a person I interviewed. I thought they would be a great team-mate. I gave in my good feedback, and was excited to hear if they accepted the position. Somewhere up the management chain, someone decided being of an older age would make them "not compatible with the company culture". Don't be like that, be as objective as possible.

Interviewing is a skill. Be well prepared and considerate!

Bad questions, for the end, personal opinions
