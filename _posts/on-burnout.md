This is not one of those "5 Steps To Tell If You have burnout" type of blog. This is about how burnout affects me and how I learned to **prevent/treat/find a good word here** it. ...

What is burnout? I won't pretend you don't know what it is. I think everyone has or will experience it at one point during their career. Burnout and Impostor Syndrome are the two mental health issues software engineers are very likely to experience. ...

Some people are not very aware of their emotions, but they still find a way to be felt. First time, for me, burnout was mostly physical. I blamed it on the stress caused by my job. It might've been true then, but now, thinking back, I know for sure it was burnout. Switching jobs fixed it, so I didn't give it much attention, until it came back again. When it comes back, you feel it more intesely. Running away is not always an option, so now, I try to prevent it. We'll see what steps I take a bit later in the post.

What do other people think about depression? Reading a few case studies ([1] [2]) ...

## How burnout feels like?

## Why do I get burnout?

It is important to know how burnout feels like. In order to fix it, you have to be aware of it. Imagine trying to work, but something pulls you back, you don't know why and you just say you are lazy. "I just have to power through the pain." You ingore what you feel, you push it away. It will come back punching, believe me. Next time you feel you are lazy, ask why?

Do these questions feel familiar? Pushing the answer away will push you 1 step towards burnout. **Our mind has ways to tell us the pain we feel should be removed, and burnout is one of those ways**. Next time, listen.

## How I try to prevent it.

Your job is not the only part of your identity.

Your actions should not make you have expectations for a certain outcome.

This may fail, but YOLO!

TDD may help??? Bonkers, I know! Hear me out.

Deployment pipeline. If you manually deploy stuff, please, for your own sake, automate it.

Consult drive:

My managers suck, I tried to change their way, but nothing seems to work. This one is easy, you won't believe it. Yup, change your job.

If you take something away from this post:

1. how do I feel burnout?
2. why do I feel it?
3. how can I fix it?
4. do I want to fix it or just replace my environment?
