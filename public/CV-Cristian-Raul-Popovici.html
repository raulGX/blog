          I worked on analytics dashboards that joined multiple data streams. The databases have hundreds of GB, meaning performance is very important. 
          I maintained a distributed in-house database that could search 10 petabytes of data. One of the major accomplishments was improving the 
          system's observability by adding metrics and dashboards.
          Currently leading an effort of breaking up a monolith into multiple microservices to improve performance and developer productivity.
